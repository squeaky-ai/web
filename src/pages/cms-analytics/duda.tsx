              <p>Visits are the times when individual visitors have visited your website or web app. A visit could last minutes or hours, but if a visitor has been inactive for 30 minutes then the visit is closed, if they reactivate then a new visit is started.</p>
              <p>If you are not familiar with how much traffic or visitors you currently have, then don&apos;t worry. You can start on the free plan and you will be notified when you are approaching your visit limit and can upgrade at that time.</p>

              <ol>
                <li>You can simply wait until your next month starts, at which point you will begin capturing new visit data using the new month&apos;s allocation.</li>
                <li>You can upgrade your plan within Squeaky, this will ensure you don&apos;t run over your limit the following month and that have no unnecessary gaps in your data for the current month.</li>
