                <p>Visits are the times when individual visitors have visited your website or web app. If a visitors has been inactive for 30 minutes then the visit is closed, if they reactivate then a new visit is started.</p>
                <p>If you are not familiar with how much traffic or visitors you currently have then don&apos;t worry. You can start on the free pricing plan and you will be notified when you have exceeded your visit limits, and can upgrade at that time.</p>
