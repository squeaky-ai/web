      <p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law&apos;s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivable the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. - See more at: <a href='https://consumercal.org/about-cfc/cfc-education-foundation/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa-3/' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>https://consumercal.org/about-cfc/cfc-education-foundation/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa-3/</a>.</p>

      <p>We honor Do Not Track signals. Do Not Track is a preference you can set in your web browser to inform websites that you do not want to be tracked. </p>
      <p>You can enable or disable Do Not Track by visiting the Preferences or Settings page of your web browser.</p>
