## Introduction

Eight months after writing our first lines of code, it’s time for [Squeaky](https://squeaky.ai) to exit beta! We’re not announcing the news with any great fanfare, but it’s an important milestone for our team nonetheless.

To mark the occasion, we thought we’d take a moment to write about how we took Squeaky from an idea, to a market-ready, validated product. Hopefully, by sharing the steps that we took, this post can serve as an interesting blueprint to others, or at least provide some insight into our journey so far.

## A little bit of background on Squeaky

There’s a decent chance you’ve come across this blog post but haven’t heard of Squeaky. So, before diving straight into process, let us start by outlining the why and the what behind Squeaky...

We started Squeaky because of a combined interest in digital privacy, and building great products. We’re all starting to have a **greater level of control over our data and privacy on the web**, which is awesome, but it also **poses a distinct challenge to companies that want to understand their customers**, and we thought we could help.

The thing is, there are undoubtedly some big, data-hungry, privacy-violating companies out there, but there are actually many more businesses that simply want to make their own corner of the web a little bit better for their customers.

Those well-intentioned companies are increasingly [unable to rely on data from tools like Google Analytics](https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/10/cnil-google-analytics-gdpr-breach/), or Hotjar. This is because their use of things like cookies, and IP tracking, make capturing a reliable and complete picture of their customer experience impossible if they wish to also respect the privacy of their visitors.

There are several great companies emerging that aim to solve this problem by offering basic privacy-first analytics dashboards. We wanted to go a step further, and offer a whole suite of customer experience analytics tools that allow businesses to surface meaningful insights about their users, without [ever having to compromise on user privacy](https://squeaky.ai/features).

Now, let’s get to the point of this blog post, the steps we took to get out of beta...

## The 4 phases that took us from idea to launch

Like a lot of founders with an idea, we had full-time jobs already. We weren’t college dropouts still living with our parents, or sitting on a student loan with abundant free time (we’re not judging, that’s an enviable position to be in!). We had bills to pay, and families to support, and we weren’t expecting to launch overnight.

With that in mind, we decided from day one that we wouldn’t rush. We’d release quickly, but take a phased approach, building at our own pace, and **taking joy in the process of making something we cared about**, and our users would love.

You’ve probably heard the advice that founders should ‘move fast and break things’, but too often people misinterpret that to mean **overworking and not worrying about quality**. Honestly though, in our experience, nobody building projects in their evenings and weekends, around work and family life, gets excited by shipping hastily-assembled junk. Instead we took the more nuanced read of the expression:

**Move fast and break things** = **Ship early to real users, and don’t be afraid to make mistakes.**

We wanted to enjoy the process, and draw motivation from our conversations with users about how to make Squeaky work for them. It didn’t need to be fast, it needed to be deliberate, and ultimately we decided the best approach would be the conventional phased-approach of Proof Of Concept (POC), Alpha, Beta and Public/Full release. We’d set milestones that marked completion of each phase, and just chip away until we got there.

### **Proof of concept**

When starting a new project you’ll often use a [proof of concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_concept#Software_development) (POC) to validate there is a market for your idea, test technical feasibility, or to attract investment. During the proof of concept phase you’re trying to prove that an idea is valuable, and/or that it is deliverable.

In our case, we were less concerned about market validation. We were entering a diverse and established market, with other players already building exciting new businesses in the privacy-focused analytics space. Naturally there are separate concerns when entering an established market, but ultimately during our POC phase, we were more concerned about technology.

This wasn’t because the problems we faced were inherently unsolvable, but due to time constraints, and the fact that only one of our two-man founding team was an engineer, we knew we’d need to rely on some existing libraries to deliver on our goals.

We decided the most important questions to answer were:

- Could we find a reliable open source library that would help us capture the session data during a users visit to a website?
- Could we then pair that with client-side data masking, and avoid the need for cookies and IP tracking?

At this stage we didn’t care at all about the user experience or product-market-fit, we just knew that if we could validate these problems were solvable, we could commit to tackling the problem.

In practice, this was much quicker than we’d anticipated. Within a few evenings we had found or developed the required tech to answer both questions with a resounding yes; the technology did work, and could work.

Maybe this sounds like a no-brainer? Of course you should test some of elements of your project before going full steam ahead! But we’ve all read horror stories about people who’ve gone headlong into an 12 month project, before realising they’d bitten off more than they could chew, Or built in the dark, failing to validate a simple POC with their target audience, and it turned out nobody wanted what they’d built.

A proof of concept protects us against this. It encourages you to stop, and ask fundamental questions about your projects viability. You use these questions to formulate simple tests you can run, and build the confidence you need to commit to your project. Ask yourself: what are the core questions I need to answer in order to give myself the confidence to commit to this project, and what’s the easiest way to answer them?

### Minimum Viable Product

So, we knew we could make the technology work, but what do users actually want? This is where Alpha testing comes in.

What the MVP should include

- Doesn’t have many features, bare essentials
    - User can authenticate
    - Users can add their site and generate a tracking code
    - User can add the tracking code to their website
    - Session data is collected in a table visible to users
    - Users can play back a session.
- Very buggy
- Limited user base (5-10 users, from our network)

What we were trying to learn

- What did the users want?
- What were the bugs?
- 

### Minimum Loveable Product

10-50 users (ended up around 80)

### Public Launch

**Incorporation and Banking**

Alpha/Beta validation cycles helped us grow the confidence we needed to incorporate/set up billing.

## What public launch means for Squeaky

**If startups should ‘keep launching’ how does a beta phase ever really end?**

- As the saying goes, a startup never really stops launching. But if you’re always experimenting and launching, can you ever really exit beta?
- List of typically ways of beta periods ending with references
- How we decided on what ending beta means for Squeaky:
    
    Ultimately there are a range of definitions exploring what it means to exit beta, but for us it comes down to feeling confident enough in our product to ask for money for it. For a lot of people that would have come earlier, there’s plenty of crappy tools out there asking for money blah blah blah
    
    We’re honestly way past the level of features any reasonable team would have added to a beta release, but that’s part of the nature of a.) listening closely to your early users and taking their feedback to heart, and b.) it being a labour of love.
    
    Now it’s something we’re ready to commit to blah blah blah
    

## How we determined our pricing model

Okay, so we knew we were ready to exit beta and, by that, introduce paid plans. But how do you decided where to start with that? User and market research mainly, with outcomes being that it:

- Needs to be flexible, in terms of model and payment processor
- Needs to be free at the point of entry - the market is too competitive to just stonewall people as a new entry to the market.
- It also needs to be flexible in terms of the ability for customers to change plans relative to their needs.

## What’s next for the Squeaky product and business
